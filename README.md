BRAIN STORKE PREDICTION A LOGISTIC REGRESSION APPROACH

This project predicts the likelihood of a person experiencing a brain stroke based on various health and demographic factors. It uses a logistic regression model for binary classification, where the target variable indicates whether a stroke occurred (1) or not (0). The aim is to demonstrate the application of machine learning in healthcare.
